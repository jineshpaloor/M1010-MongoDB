Schema
======

One to One
-----------

  In mongodb why we want to keep two documents that are related to each other one-to-one in separate collections?
    * to reduce the working set size of your application.
    * because the combined size of the documents would be larger than 16MB.

Many to Many Relations
----------------------

  Query to get list of students of a particular teacher use indexing.
  
    db.students.ensureIndex({'teachers':1});
    db.students.find({'teachers':{$all:[1]}});

Benefits of Embedding
---------------------

  * Improved Read Performance
  * One Round trip to the DB
